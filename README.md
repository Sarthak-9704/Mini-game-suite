Mini-game-suite:

This is a project having multiple different programs all written in C++. 
The idea of this project was to implement a structure similar to that of well-known game suites such as roblox or purble place which have multiple mini games within one application.
C++ does not allow the use of applets which meant I had to use executables from one file to another.
Linking the files together to use the executables from one file to another was challenging and could have been avoided if this program was written in a language such as Java or Lua which allow the use of applets but the aim of this was simply to help me gain hands-on experience in C++.
